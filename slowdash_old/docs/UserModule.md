title: User Module
---

# Applications
In Slow-Dash projects, user Python module can be used for:

- sending data to the web interface (table, tree, etc)
- dispatching "command" from the web interface

SlowTask is an extension of the user module, and it should be good for most simple cases. User module is provided for full flexibility beyond SlowTask.

# Project Configuration File
```yaml
slowdash_project:
  name: ...
  module:
    file: FILE_PATH
    parameters:
        KEY1: VALUE1
        ...
    data_suffix: SUFFIX
    cgi_enabled: False
```

[TODO] implement SUFFIX

By default, user modules are not enabled if the server program is launched by CGI. To enable this, set the `cgi_enabled` parameter `True`. Be careful for all the side effects, including performance overhead and security issues. As multiple user modules can be loaded in parallel, splitting functions to a CGI-enabled module and disabled one might be a good strategy.

### Example
```yaml
slowdash_project:
  name: ...
  module:
    file: ./mymodule.py
```
- `mymodule.py` at the user project directory will be loaded to slow-dash.
- Call-back functions in `mymodule.py` will be called for various context.


# User Module structure
```python
### Called when this module is loaded. The params are the parameters in the configuration file.
def _initialize(params):
    ...

    
### Called during termination of slow-dash.
def _finalize():
    ...

    
### Called when web clients need a list of available channels.
# Return a list of channel struct, e.g.,  [ { "name": NAME1, "type": TYPE1 }, ... ]
def get_channels():
    ...
    return []


### Called when web clients request data.
# If the channel is not known, return None
# else return a JSON object of the data, in the format described in the Data Model document.
def _get_data(channel):
    ...
    return None


### Called when web clients send a command.
# If command is not recognized, return None
# elif command is executed successfully, return True
# else return False or { "status": "error", "message": ... }
def _process_command(doc):
    ...
    return None


### Called periodically while the system is running
# If this function is defined, a dedicated thread is created for that.
# Do not forget to insert a sleep otherwise the system load becomes unnecessarily large.
def _loop():
    ...
    time.sleep(0.1)


### Instead of loop(), a lower level implementation with run() and halt() can also be used.
# run() is called as a thread after initialize(), and halt() is called before finalize().
is_stop_requested = False
def _run():
    global is_stop_requested
    while not is_stop_requested:
        ....
        time.sleep(0.1)
def _halt():
    global is_stop_requested
    is_stop_requested = True
```

[TODO] implement the full data-source interface


# Example User Data Source
### Project Configuration File
```yaml
slowdash_project:
  name: WorldClock
  module:
    file: worldclock.py
    parameters:
        timeoffset: -9
    data_suffix: worldclock
```

### Python Module
```python
# worldclock.py

import time, datetime
timeoffset = 0

def _initialize(params):
    global timeoffset
    timeoffset = params.get('timeoffset', 0)

    
def _get_channels():
    return [
        {'name': 'WorldClock', 'type': 'tree'},
    ]


def _get_data(channel):
    if channel == 'WorldClock':
        t = time.time()
        dt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(t)
        return { 'tree': {
            'UnixWorldClock': t,
            'UTC': dt.astimezone(datetime.timezone.utc).isoformat(),
            'Local': dt.astimezone().isoformat(),
            '%+dh'%timeoffset: dt.astimezone(tz).isoformat()
        }}

    return None


# for testing
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(_get_data(get_channels()[0]['name']))
```

### Testing the module
Running the `slowdash` command without a port number option shows the query result to screen. The query string is given as the first argument.

Two queries are useful to test the module:

- `channel`: query for a channel list
- `data/CHANNEL`: query for data for the channel

```console
$ slowdash channels
[{ "name": "WorldClock", "type": "tree" }]

$ slowdash data/WorldClock
{ "WorldClock": { "start": 1678801863.0, "length": 3600.0, "t": 1678805463.0, "x": { "tree": {
    "UnixTime": 1678805463.7652955,
    "UTC": "2023-03-14T14:51:03.765296+00:00",
    "Local": "2023-03-14T15:51:03.765296+01:00",
    "-9h": "2023-03-14T05:51:03.765296-09:00"
}}}}
```
(the output above is reformatted for better readability)


### Using it from web browser
- Start slow-dash at the project directory
- Add a new  "Tree" panel, with channel "WorldClock".

# Example User Command Dispatcher

To the example user data source above, add the following function:

### Python Module
```python
def _process_command(doc):
    global timeoffset
    try:
        if doc.get('set_time_offset', False):
            timeoffset = int(doc.get('time_offset', None))
            return True
    except Exception as e:
        return { "status": "error", "message": str(e) }

    return False

```

Make a HTML form to send commands from Web browser:
```html
<form>
  Time Offset (hours): <input type="number" name="time_offset" value="0">
  <input type="submit" name="set_time_offset" value="Set">
</form>
```
Save the file at the `config` directory under the user project direcotry.
Add a new HTML panel with HTML file `WorldClock`.

<img src="fig/UserModule-Dispatcher.png" style="width:70%;border:thin solid gray">

When the `Set` button is clicked, the form data is sent to the user module as a JSON document. On the terminal screen where the slowdash command is running, you can see a message like:
```
POST: /slowdash.cgi/control
23-03-14 16:37:46 INFO: DISPATCH: {'set_time_offset': True, 'time_offset': '3'}
```

# User Module Threading
A dedicated thread is created for each user module, and the module is loaded within the thread. Therefore, all the statements outside a function will be executed in this thread at the time of module loading, followed by `_initialize()`. 

If the `_loop()` function is defined in a user module, the function is called periodically within the user module thread:
```python
def _loop():
    do_my_task()
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

If the `_run()` function is defined, a dedicated thread is created and the function will be started immediately after `_initialize()`. When `_run()` is used, a terminator function, `_halt()` should also be defined in the user module to stop the thread. The `_halt()` function is called just before `_finalize()`. A typical construction of `_run()` and `_halt()` looks like:
```python
is_stop_requested = False

def _run():
    global is_stop_requested
    while not is_stop_requested:
        do_my_task()
        time.sleep(0.1)

def _halt():
    global is_stop_requested
    is_stop_requested = True    
```

If both `_run()` and `loop()` are defined, `run()` is called first (after `_initialize()`), followed by `loop()` and `finalize()`.

All the other callback functions, such as `_process_command()`, `_get_channels()`, and `_get_data()`, are called from the main Slowdash thread (not the user module thread) and therefore these can be called concurrently with the user thread callbacks (`_initialize()`, `_loop()`, `_run()`, etc.). It is okay to start another thread in user modules, as done in SlowTask which creates a dedicated thread for each `_process_command()` call.

# Tips
### Debug / Log Messages 
 To print debug messages from user modules, use the logging module:
```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(name)
logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(sys.stderr))
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

def _process_command(doc):
    logger.info(doc)
    ...
```

### User Task Class
To avoid using a number of "global" variables, consider making a class to handle user tasks and using the user module interface functions for simply forwarding the messages.
```python
class MyTask:
    ....

my_task = MyTask()

def _loop():
    my_task.do()
    time.sleep(0.1)
    
def _process_command(doc):
    return my_task.process_command(doc)    
```

### Standalone Mode
It is often convenient to have the user module executable standalone. 
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    _initialize({})
    for i in range(10):
        _loop()
    _finalize()
```

For contineous execution, signal might be used to stop the thread:
```python
def stop(signum, frame):
    _halt()
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import signal
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, stop)
    _initialize({})
    _run()
    _finalize()
```
